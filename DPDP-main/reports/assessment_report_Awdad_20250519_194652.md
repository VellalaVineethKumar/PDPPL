# **Compliance Report**

## **Executive Summary**
The overall compliance score is **23.5%**, indicating **non-compliance** with the **Personal Data Protection Principles (PDPPL)**. Significant gaps exist in documentation, audit processes, legal justification for data processing, and security measures for sensitive data. Immediate action is required to address these deficiencies and mitigate legal and reputational risks.

## **Section Analysis & Risk Assessment**

### **1. Applicability of the PDPPL (50% Compliance)**
- **Risk Level:** **Moderate**  
- **Implications:** Inadequate documentation may lead to regulatory penalties and non-compliance with PDPPL requirements.  
- **Action Items:**  
  - **Enhance documentation practices** to align with PDPPL.  
  - **Leverage Informatica Data Governance** to track processing activities.  

### **2. Principles of Data Privacy (25% Compliance)**
- **Risk Level:** **High**  
- **Implications:** Lack of audit processes and centralized **Record of Processing Activities (RoPA)** increases non-compliance risk.  
- **Action Items:**  
  - **Implement audit mechanisms** using **Informatica Data Governance**.  
  - **Develop a RoPA** with **Informatica Cloud Data Governance** to document processing activities, retention periods, and third-party disclosures.  

### **3. Permitted Reason (0% Compliance)**
- **Risk Level:** **Critical**  
- **Implications:** No legal justification for data processing exposes the organization to regulatory action.  
- **Action Items:**  
  - **Establish a legal framework** for processing justification (consent, contractual necessity, legal obligation, legitimate interest).  
  - **Use Informatica Cloud Data Governance & Catalog (CDGC) and Cloud Data Access Management (CDAM)** to automate consent management.  

### **4. Special Nature Processing & Security (0% Compliance)**
- **Risk Level:** **Critical**  
- **Implications:** Sensitive data (health, biometrics, children’s data) is unprotected, increasing breach risks.  
- **Action Items:**  
  - **Classify and monitor sensitive data** with **Informatica Data Privacy Management**.  

### **5. Governance & Training Awareness (0% Compliance)**
- **Risk Level:** **High**  
- **Implications:** Lack of policies and training increases compliance failures.  
- **Action Items:**  
  - **Develop governance policies** and **training programs** for staff.  

### **6. Data Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA) (0% Compliance)**
- **Risk Level:** **High**  
- **Implications:** No risk assessment framework for new processing activities.  
- **Action Items:**  
  - **Implement a DPIA framework** with **Informatica Log Analyzer** for automated compliance tracking.  

### **7. Cross-Border Data Flows & Third-Party Agreements (0% Compliance)**
- **Risk Level:** **High**  
- **Implications:** Unregulated data sharing with third parties increases breach risks.  
- **Action Items:**  
  - **Establish data protection agreements** with processors using **Informatica Data Governance & Compliance**.  

### **8. Data Breach Response (0% Compliance)**
- **Risk Level:** **Critical**  
- **Implications:** No breach response plan increases financial and reputational damage.  
- **Action Items:**  
  - **Develop a breach response plan** with **Informatica Cloud Data Ingestion & Replication (CDIR)** for backup and recovery.  

### **9. Children’s Data (100% Compliance)**
- **Status:** **Fully compliant** – No action required.
