accordance with the following:

1. Qatar National Vision 2030:

The policy aligns with the objectives set forth in the Qatar National Vision 2030, which emphasizes the use of data 
as a strategic asset for promoting economic, social, and technological development in Qatar. This policy supports the 
nation’s vision of building a knowledge-based economy driven by data-driven decision-
making.

2. Law No. (13) of 2016 On Personal Data Privacy Protection:

The policy operates in full compliance with Qatar’s Personal Data Privacy Protection Law, which safeguards the privacy 
of individuals and outlines strict regulations on the collection, processing, and use of personal data. This law provides the 
foundation for the ethical use and management of data across all sectors in Qatar, ensuring compliance with global privacy 
standards.

3. Law No. (14) of 2014 On Cybercrime Prevention:

In line with the Cybercrime Prevention Law, the policy mandates robust data protection measures and cybersecurity 
protocols to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. It reinforces the need for government and semi-government 
entities to adhere to strict security standards to protect Qatar’s critical data infrastructure.

 NATIONAL PLANNING COUNCIL

1.  Introduction
In the digital era, data is often referred to as the “new oil” due to its significance in driving innovation, economic 
growth, and societal advancement. Effective data management and governance optimize the value of this asset, 
ensuring data accuracy, security, and accessibility. Data governance sets the policies, standards, and practices 
necessary for managing data throughout its lifecycle, serving as the foundation for informed decision-making. 
Proper governance and effective data management are especially crucial in supporting Qatar’s 
vision of becoming a leader in data management, digital services, and information technology, in 
alignment with the broader objectives of the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3.0). 
By promoting a culture of data quality and transparency, data management practices facilitate easy 
collaboration and information sharing across entities. This step not only enhances the efficiency and 
effectiveness of digital services but also paves the way for the implementation of innovative solutions 
and the utilization of emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative AI. These 
technologies rely on high-quality, comprehensive datasets to train AI models and automate complex processes. 
The National Data Policy is designed to support Qatar’s vision of establishing a data-driven economy. It provides 
guidance to entities within its scope for the primary and strategic management of data. This policy serves as the 
foundational reference for all entities in Qatar, aiming to ensure data management across all sectors with the 
highest levels of accuracy, consistency, and excellence. It also clearly defines roles, responsibilities, and ownership, 
establishing accountability for adhering to data management practices across the country, thereby supporting Qatar’s 
vision of a technologically advanced, data-driven future. Accordingly, the National Data Standards - developed 
by NPC - are a crucial component in supporting this policy. These standards outline the essential procedures for 
effective data management, ensuring regulatory compliance and promoting best practices across all entities. They 
provide detailed guidance, facilitating a structured and consistent approach to data management within Qatar.
In addition to the National Data Standards, this policy is supported by a range of other key laws, 
policies, and standards, including:

01 Personal Data Privacy Protection Law 05 National Data Classification Policy

02 Cybercrime Prevention Law 06 Cloud First Policy

03 Right to Access Information Law 07 National Information Assurance 
Standard

04 Qatar’s Open Data Policy 08 National Framework for Quality 
Assurance of Official Statistics 

By establishing standardized processes and governance frameworks across entities in Qatar, this policy 
lays the foundation for a future where data-driven strategic insights significantly enhance decision-
making and improve public services.

1.2   National Data Management Framework

The National Data Management Framework (NDMF) stands as a strategic foundation for 
Qatar’s data maturity journey, aligning data practices across entities and sectors to harness the 
transformative power of data. The National Data Management Framework has been structured 
across 5 distinct layers and 12 Data Management Domains (refer to Figure 1 below).

01 Oversight layer is the overarching layer that shall anchor the Data Management journey of 
every entity and is comprised of 1 Data Management Domain: Data Strategy & Governance.

The Data Enablement layer is the foundational layer that shall convert the entity’s data into 
a discoverable, interoperable, and high-quality asset that is ready for value extraction and 

02 utilization. This layer is comprised of 6 distinct Data Management Domains: Data Architecture 
& Modeling, Data Quality Management, Master and Reference Data Management, Document 
and Content Management, Data Catalog and Metadata Management, Data Storage and 
Operations.

The Data Impact Realization layer is the layer that shall extract value from the Data asset. 

03 Most of today’s effort and visibility by entities is focused on this layer as it produces tangible 
direct and indirect outcomes. This layer is comprised of 3 Data Management Domains: Data 
Sharing, Integration and Interoperability, Statistics and Analytics, Data Monetization.

The Data Protection & Privacy / Data Defense and Resilience layer is the layer that shall 

04 ensure the Data asset is adequately classified and secured both from a security as well as 
privacy perspectives. This layer is comprised of 1 Data Management Domain: Data Security, 
Privacy and Other Regulations.

Culture and Change layer is the last and fifth layer, This layer shall ensure that Data talent 
and Data culture are adequately built for a sustainable data maturity journey by the entities. 

05 Considering the expected fast changing technology landscape and disruptions, this layer 
should be of strategic and consistent focus by the entities. Finally, this layer is comprised of 1 
Data Management Domain: Data Culture and Literacy.

These domains align with established standards and frameworks such as DAMA International’s Data Management 
Body of Knowledge (DMBOK), The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) and Unified Modeling 
Language (UML), methodologies like Six Sigma and Total Quality Management (TQM) along with standards like 
ISO 8000 for data quality, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), ISO 32000 for PDFs and ISO 15489 for 
records management. These standards ensure that Qatar’s data management practices are robust, interoperable, 
and aligned with global best practices, enabling efficient data governance and utilization across diverse sectors.
